# NestPals
This is a WIP project dedicated to matching roommates in multiple ways.

# Installation
To install this project, you need 3 tools:
- Git, to obtain the project files from this repository.
- node.js (primarily npm:node package manager (comes pre-installed with node.js))
- Vite, a local development server to run the project on.

1. Install the latest git version from https://git-scm.com/
Confirm it's properly installed by running 'git version' in an open command prompt.![image](https://github.com/zhirongfu/NestPals/assets/73326132/e292a296-da17-483c-abaa-11ce31479517)

   Install the latest version of node.js from https://nodejs.org/en

  3. Create an empty folder and copy the path to that folder. In Command Prompt, navigate to that folder with cd "path to that folder".

4. Now that you are in that folder do `git clone https://github.com/zhirongfu/NestPals.git` ![image](https://github.com/zhirongfu/NestPals/assets/73326132/da9ee13a-8afa-4df3-93dc-aafc97ed3ebe)
5. Since our app is a folder within a folder you have to now `cd NestPals\NestPalsHomePage` ![image](https://github.com/zhirongfu/NestPals/assets/73326132/c0ef695d-8c68-429a-8ae3-9814286ef49d)
 

# Installing vite
Our last step is to install vite. We can choose to install it globally or locally in the project folder. (It is best pratice to install it locally within the project folder since different versions might be used for different projects, and the package.json file will dictate the correct version)

6. To do this we do `npm install vite --save-dev` in the current directory we are in alternatively you can simply just do `npm install` (as vite is already listed as a dev dependency in our .json files ![Screenshot 2024-05-21 015458](https://github.com/zhirongfu/NestPals/assets/73326132/5f751459-3ae3-421d-8673-510ed1a07e83)

7. We can check if it's installed with `npm list vite` inside that directory(which will return the version) ![image](https://github.com/zhirongfu/NestPals/assets/73326132/632fbc15-90dc-4691-a1ff-18827dbdf23d)
8. Now we run `npm start` in the current directory which would prompt us with a link to a local server ![image](https://github.com/zhirongfu/NestPals/assets/73326132/38ec9f06-447e-41e0-a7fc-127b8ff313cd)
9. Finally we can follow that link with Ctrl+Click or by simply copy and pasting the link to a browser to open up the web app! ![image](https://github.com/zhirongfu/NestPals/assets/73326132/b484443d-ab91-4878-84de-2d92867a9b98)
