This is a WIP project dedicated to matching roommates in multiple ways.

# Installation
To install this project, you need 3 tools:
- Git, to obtain the project files from this repository.
- node.js (primarily npm:node package manager (comes pre-installed with node.js)
- Vite, a local development server to run the project on.

# Using git
The easier of the 3 steps is to clone the repository into a local machine using git.
1. Install the latest git version from https://git-scm.com/
Confirm it's properly installed by running 'git version' in an open command prompt.

4. In Command Prompt, navigate to an empty folder of your choice to install the project in, and type
`git clone https://github.com/MikeK-003/NestPals.git` using the copied link.

6. If installed correctly, git should handle the downloading of all files into the specified folder by itself.
