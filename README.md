# NestPals
This is a WIP project dedicated to matching roommates in multiple ways.

# Installation
To install this project, you need two tools:
- Git, to obtain the project files from this repository.
- Vite, a local development server to run the project on.

# Using git
The easier of the two steps is to clone the repository into a local machine using git.
1. Install the latest git version from https://git-scm.com/
Confirm it's properly installed by running 'git version' in an open command prompt.

3. You have the choice of downloading all the files as-is, or you can copy the git repository link.

4. In Command Prompt, navigate to an empty folder of your choice to install the project in, and type
`git clone https://github.com/MikeK-003/NestPals.git` using the copied link.

6. If installed correctly, git should handle the downloading of all files into the specified folder by itself.

# Installing vite
The next step is to be able to properly run the app using Vite.
The instructions are given here, but many of the dependencies have already been installed.

All that has already been taken care of.

4. Navigate to the homepage directory by typing in `cd NestPalsHomePage`.

5. Type `npm start` and open the project by pressing `o + enter`.
